The MBMS Middleware presents the heart of the 5G-MAG Reference Tools. Its main task is to provide the best available content to the (internal or external) application at any time. If available, it combines content from (mobile) broadband, WiFi with the 5G BC content from the MBMS Modem using an advanced decision logic.

**A detailed overview and the installation instructions can be found in our [Wiki](https://github.com/5G-MAG/Documentation-and-Architecture/wiki/MBMS-Middleware).**
